Examples of Incorrected Responses:
1. You got it! There are many ways to solve math problems and learn math. Now that we have connected, let's solve some more problems.
2. Good Job.
3. I would say she is doing well and let us explore a bit more.
4. I think you are doing great.
5. You can do this! Just take it one step at a time.

Examples of correct responses are shown as below: 
1. Kevin, you didn't give up and you managed to learn, congratulations! Let's finish your math homework together so you can still get a good grade and learn how this kind of homework will be easier sooner.
2. Keep Working
3. Great job Kevin! You are on the right track, keep working on the problem, you get it!
4. Kevin, that was awesome the way you kept at it and were able to get to the correct answer. You should be proud. Keep up the great work!
5. You're doing a great job working on this paragraph! It can be tricky to find the right words and I think you're doing really well working through it.

instruction1 = """According to the lesson principle, please determine if the following response contains praising for learning effort. If the following response contains praising for learning effort, please respond YES; if not, please respond NO."""



principle = """


The following is the principle that a correct response should follow: 

Studies show praise is most effective when it has certain qualities.
Praise should be:

perceived as sincere, earned, and truthful.
specific by giving details of what the student did well.
immediate with praise given right after the student action.
authentic and is not repeated often, such as "great job" which loses meaning and becomes predictable.
focused on the learning process, not ability

Giving students consistent, specific praise when they perform in a desired manner is important to motivate students and increase their engagement to learn. Expert tutors and research suggest giving praise that focuses on the process and not merely student ability. Process-focused praise recognizes students for putting forth effort and persevering through the learning process instead of focusing on whether a student got the problem correct or pure ability. Process-focused praise motivates students to learn and fosters a growth mindset (Dweck, 2008).

Some common examples of ability-focused praise are shown on the left in the table below with a corresponding more effective process-focused praise shown on the right. It is important to note that praise can be given throughout the learning process, not only upon getting the correct answer or finishing a problem or assignment. Oftentimes, encouragement and praise can be given while the student is going through the learning process to increase motivation and maintain engagement.
